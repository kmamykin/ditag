SimpleObject
============

Extremely Simple Embed/Object tag helper. Although parameters can be overridden, basic defaults
 are inferred from the provided 'source' parameter. As much as I like the SWFObject helper in 
javascript, I use code like this for projects, where i just don't want to be lugging around
yet another javascript file. Just a simple extension to ActionView is all I really want to be 
using for media-rich sites!

Usage:
	<p><%= simple_object_tag "/example.mp3" %></p>
	<p><%= simple_object_tag "/example.mov",:width=>640,:height=>480 %></p>
	<p><%= simple_object_tag "/example.swf",:width=>100,:height=>200,:some_attribute=>"some_value" %></p>
